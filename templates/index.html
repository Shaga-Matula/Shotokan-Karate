                        <p>What is Karate?</p>
                    </h2>
                  
                        <p>Karate (translated as ‘empty hand’) is an ancient method of unarmed fighting with a moral
                            warrior
                            code
                            emphasising punching, striking and kicking. It was developed on the Island of Okinawa (now
                            part
                            of
                            Japan) by fusing local fighting skills with techniques from near-by China. It was practised
                            as
                            an
                            art of
                            self-defence by a small elite group who closely guarded their methods, only passing them on
                            to a
                            few
                            trusted students.</p>

                        <p>But in the early 1900s karate was introduced into Okinawan schools and masters, like the
                            founder
                            of
                            the
                            Shotokan style, Gichin Funakoshi, later took it to mainland Japan where it quickly became
                            established
                            alongside traditional Japanese martial arts such as Judo and Kendo (sword-fighting).<p>

                                <p>The art spread as a strict, disciplined way of life. Later a new type of sparring was
                                    developed
                                    to allow safe competitive fighting where blows were pulled short of contact to avoid
                                    injury.
                                    This new sporting side greatly enhanced karate’s appeal and from the 1950s it spread
                                    rapidly
                                    around the world as the main Japanese karate organisations sent senior instructors
                                    abroad to
                                    teach. Millions of men, women and children of all ages and backgrounds now practice
                                    Karate
                                    and
                                    clubs compete in national and international tournaments. But many karate styles like
                                    Shotokan
                                    still emphasise the traditional moral codes, ways of training and self-defence
                                    techniques
                                    developed by the masters of past centuries.</p>
