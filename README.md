# <span style="color:blue;">Introduction</span>
### The Shotokan website is designed to introduce potential karate students to Shotokan Karate as a means to achieve a healthier lifestyle and a healthy state of mind. The website aims to provide an engaging and informative experience for visitors. Shotokan Karate is a dynamic martial art style created by the late, great Gichin Funakoshi. The philosophy of Shotokan Karate is based on the traditional Budo (martial arts) spirit of Karate, which seeks the perfection of character through hard work and discipline. Shotokan Karate is a form of self-defense that is built on a strong foundation of physical and mental training.


# Landing Page
* Upon visiting the website, the student is presented with a visually appealing landing page. The landing page features a hero image that captures the essence of Shotokan Karate and immediately grabs the attention of the visitor. The navigation bar provides easy access to different sections of the website, allowing users to explore further. Additionally, a contact form is prominently displayed, enabling potential students to reach out for more information or inquiries.
# Registration Process
* If a student decides to take up lessons, they can use the contact us form to express interest. I they become students the head instructor can register through a form integrated into the website. This registration form is built using Django, along with Bootstrap for enhanced styling and responsiveness. The use of Django allows for efficient handling of form submissions and data management. The information provided by the student will be securely stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring the privacy and security of their personal details.
* By leveraging the power of Django, Bootstrap, and Python, the registration process is streamlined and user-friendly. The integration of these technologies enables a seamless user experience, making it easy for instructors to register students to sign up for lessons and become part of the Shotokan Karate community.
* The ultimate goal of the Shotokan website is to provide an engaging and informative platform that encourages potential students to explore the benefits of Shotokan Karate and take the first step towards a healthier lifestyle and a positive state of mind.

By following best practices for website design, such as using a consistent color scheme, using whitespace effectively, and using high-quality images, we aim to create a website that is visually appealing and engaging for users.




## User experience


* Home Page: The home page should have a clear and concise navigation menu that allows users to easily access different sections of the website. It should also have a search bar that allows students to search for classes and instructors.

* Instructor Dashboard: The instructor dashboard should allow instructors to create, read, update, and delete information about classes, students, and other instructors. It    should also allow them to view their schedule and upcoming classes.

* Student Dashboard: The student dashboard should allow students to view their class schedule, grades, and attendance records. '** It should also allow them to search for classes and instructors, and sign up for classes.**'

* Grade Pages: Each class page should have a detailed description of the grade material, including the Kata name, and any prerequisites. 

* Instructor Pages: Each instructor page should have a detailed bio, including their qualifications, experience, and teaching style. It should also have a list of classes they teach and a schedule of their upcoming classes.

* Contact Page: The contact page should have a form that allows students to send messages to instructors and the school administration. It should also have a list of frequently asked questions and answers.


## Agile Aproach

* The Agile approach is a flexible project management methodology that emphasizes collaboration and iterative development. It is widely used in software development but can be applied to various industries and projects. The Agile approach focuses on delivering value to customers through incremental and frequent delivery of small chunks of functionality. One of the key components of the Agile approach is the use of user stories, which are short descriptions of what a user wants to achieve with a product or service. User stories follow a specific format: "As a [user], I want to [action], so that I [outcome]". The use of user stories helps to capture the user's perspective and prioritize work.

* In GitHub, labels are used to categorize issues and pull requests. They can help you keep track of what needs to be done and what's already been done. I have create some labels and used some of the default ones. Labels can be used to indicate the priority of an issue, the type of issue, or the status of an issue. For example, "bug", "enhancement", "high priority", "in progress", or "done".
## User Stories

* The user story template in this project is a widely used format for defining user requirements in Agile software development. The template follows the format of "As a [user], I want to [action], so that [outcome]". The template is used to capture user requirements in a concise and structured manner, making it easier for the development team to understand and implement them.
* The user story template in this project includes three sections: Estimation Effort, Tasks, and Acceptance Criteria. The Estimation Effort section uses the Fibonacci sequence to estimate the amount of effort required to complete each task. The Tasks section lists the specific tasks that need to be completed to achieve the user story. The Acceptance Criteria section lists the criteria that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.
* The use of the Fibonacci sequence in the Estimation Effort section is a common practice in Agile software development. The Fibonacci sequence is a numerical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence is often used in Agile software development to estimate the amount of effort required to complete a task. The sequence is used because it allows for a more accurate estimation of effort, as it takes into account the uncertainty and complexity of software development.
* The user story template in this project is a useful tool for Agile software development teams. It provides a structured and concise format for capturing user requirements and helps to ensure that the development team understands and implements them correctly. By using this template, the development team can work more efficiently and effectively, resulting in a higher quality product that meets the needs of the users.

### DataBase Design

### Normalizing definition
* Normalizing a database table means organizing the information in a way that makes it easier to manage and prevents mistakes. It's like putting your toys away in a toy box so you can find them easily and don't lose any. In a database, we put similar information together in a table and make sure each piece of information is only stored in one place. This helps to avoid repeating information and makes it easier to update the information if needed. Normalizing a database table is like keeping your room clean and tidy so you can find everything you need quickly and easily.

### Pre-Normalizing 
* This is the database table named "Students" before normalizing; it stores information about martial arts students. It has 20 fields, including a primary key field "CustomerID" and also relevant data values, such as Varchar and Boolean. Please note this is a mock-up and tables and data values may change during design and implementation.
